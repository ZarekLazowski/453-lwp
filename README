USER INFO:
This set of files is a light-weight process library. The library by default 
uses a round robin scheduler, however the user is able to replace the scheduler
with one of their own choosing. 

This was created in a virtual Ubuntu x86 environment, and is not intended
to run outside of a unix-based system.

INSTRUCTIONS:
Provided makefile creates .a and .so libraries used in desired multithreaded 
programs. Make sure to include the library when building a multithreaded 
program and include lwp.h.

To replace the defulat scheduler, one needs to create a scheduler structure
(defined in lwp.h, line 56) and call the lwp_set_scheduler function.

An example program is can be built by making 'nums'
